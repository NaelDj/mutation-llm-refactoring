# Replication Package

This replication package contains the modified `pom.xml` files and Maven toolchain configuration used for the thesis runs.

## Setup

1. Download or clone the specific project release mentioned in the thesis report.

2. Replace the project’s original `pom.xml` with the corresponding `pom.xml` from this replication package.

3. Copy the provided `toolchains.xml` file to your local Maven configuration folder:

   **Linux/macOS**
   ```bash
   ~/.m2/toolchains.xml
````

**Windows**

```powershell
%USERPROFILE%\.m2\toolchains.xml
```

4. Make sure the JDK path inside `toolchains.xml` matches the location of the required JDK on your machine.

5. Copy the provided `tools` folder into the root of the project repository. The folder should be placed next to the project’s `pom.xml`, so the scripts can be run from the expected location.

6. Run the provided scripts or Maven commands as described in the thesis report.
